v1.5

New Configure screen!

- When adding/editing your widget, now you will see a preview.
- Also, new favorite action. Now, the action on each app can be configured. Was "Uninstall" by default.

v1.4

Android Oreo+ support.

Persistent notification has to be added to be able to keep the widget up-to-date.
I don't think this will consume much battery but it is shown like that since it is a background service.
Any feedback is welcome!
