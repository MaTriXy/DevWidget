v1.3

Added additional 3 options into overflow
- Open in Play Store
- App Settings (only displayed if the app has necessary intent-filter)
- App Notification Settings (only displayed if the app has necessary intent-filter)

A bug that exists from the beginning has been resolved: When multiple widgets exist, the configuration button was openning the wrong widget screen.
